        <p id="summary">I received an assignment in my A.P. U.S. history class to make google slides on World War 2. The slides consisted of a paragraph and three pictures per subject. The hardest part was choosing what to write about in each paragraph. I personally have an interest in World War 2, as a result I have a lot of knowledge on the subject which allowed me to complete the project easier.</p>
